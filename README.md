# 🃏 Blackjack Game 🃏
## Welcome to the Blackjack game! 🎉🎉

In this game, you will be playing against the dealer. 
The goal is to get a hand with a higher total value than the dealer's hand without going over 21.


## 🎮 How to Play 🎮
Click the "Deal" button to start the game.

You will be dealt two cards face up, and the dealer will be dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.

You can choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to keep your current hand.

If your hand goes over 21, you will "Bust" and lose the game.

Once you have chosen to stand, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and hit until their hand total is 17 or higher.

If the dealer's hand total is higher than yours without going over 21, you lose the game. 

If your hand total is higher than the dealer's hand total without going over 21, you win the game.
